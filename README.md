# ConsumerComplainPredictionModel

Introduction
In the current world Machine Learning and NLP is very widely used field and broad research area to predict very useful things. In our project we aim to build a prediction model that will accurately classify which texts are spam. The dataset we are using consists of real-world complaints received about financial products and services. Each complaint has been labeled with a specific product; therefore, this is a supervised text classification problem. With the aim to classify future complaints based on its content, we used different machine learning algorithms can make more accurate predictions. To perform pre-processing, we are using NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques like Removing Punctuation and Stop words, Tokenizer, Bag of words and Term frequency inverse document frequency (TFIDF) for Text Analysis before applying Machine Learning algorithms.

Methodology and approach
As stated in our introduction, our aim is to develop a program that can classify Consumer complaints into predefined categories. We will be solving the problem with high accuracy and in efficient way. We shall use NLP techniques for pre-processing the data. Thereafter apply classification Linear Support Vector Machine (Linear SVM), Random Forest, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. These algorithms offer very advanced solution to our problems and they can be very efficient in right usage area.
